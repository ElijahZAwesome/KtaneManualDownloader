# Ktane Manual Downloader
This program allows you to download updated manuals for your installed KTANE mods.

The manuals are grabbed from the [Repository of Manual Pages](https://ktane.timwi.de/).

# Prerequisites:
If the app won't launch, make sure you've installed the [.NET Framework 4.7.2 Runtime or higher.](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472)
Make sure not to install the developer pack unless you actually want it.

# Usage
To use it, simply open it up, and type/browser your game's mod folder.

For workshop mods, this path will be something like:
`C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\341800`

For local mods, this path will be something like:
`C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes\mods`

Make sure to press enter at the end to submit your input.

After you've done that, configure your settings and press Download, and wait for a little bit.

# Notes
Please note that this in in-dev software made by an inexperienced dev, so bugs and oddities are to be expected.

# TODO:
1. ~~Make append(ixes) work~~ This has been scrapped but maybe ill fix it someday
2. Write a tutorial for building (it should work out of box, right?)
3. Make an updater?
4. Make an Icon, the default Atlas one makes me feel bad.
